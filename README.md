### Adding Posts 

The "Adding Posts" feature allows BlogCMS users to create new blog posts. The user can enter a title, post content, and optionally add an image illustrating the content. After creating the post, it is saved in the Firebase database.

### Assigning Posts to Categories 

The "Assigning Posts to Categories" feature allows BlogCMS users to categorize their posts. The user can choose an existing category or create a new one, and then assign the post to the selected category. This helps organize content and facilitates navigation for readers on the blog.

### Checking Subscriptions 

The "Checking Subscriptions" feature allows BlogCMS users to monitor subscribers of the Programming Blog web application. The user can view a list of subscribers, see their contact information, and optionally manage subscriptions.

### Controlling Comment Content 

The "Controlling Comment Content" feature allows BlogCMS users to moderate comments posted under the posts. The user can view a list of comments, approve or reject a comment, and remove inappropriate content. This helps maintain the quality of discussions and ensure high-quality content.
